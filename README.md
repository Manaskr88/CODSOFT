#Task-1 : Portfolio
"I'm thrilled to share my latest project - a portfolio website built with HTML and CSS! I wanted to create a site that showcased my skills and experience, and I'm really happy with how it turned out.

The site features a transparent navigation bar that stays fixed to the top of the page, making it easy for visitors to find what they're looking for. The hero section includes a full-width background image and text that's centered both vertically and horizontally, and the about section showcases an image on the left and text on the right.
The services and portfolio sections use Bootstrap cards to display information in a visually appealing way. I included a hover effect on the portfolio cards to give the site a little extra flair, and I used font awesome icons to make the services section more engaging.
The footer features social media icons that are styled with font awesome, and I included a copyright symbol to give more professional look.
Overall, I'm really proud of how the site turned out, and I can't wait to see what projects I'll build next!"

#Task-2 : Calculator

I am thrilled to share my latest project from a recent internship - a GUI-based simple calculator built using HTML, CSS.
This calculator features a sleek design and user-friendly interface. I had a great time working on this project and learned a lot about web development and user experience design. I am grateful for the opportunity to apply my skills in a real-world setting and improve my problem-solving, communication, and project management abilities. 
This calculator is a great example of my ability to work independently and collaboratively, and I am looking forward to continuing to grow and learn in my career
